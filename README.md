This is a fork of [danShumway's serverboy](https://github.com/danShumway/serverboy.js), itself heavily based on [rauchg's gameboy](https://github.com/rauchg/gameboy), which is itself heavily based on
Grant Galitz's earlier work with [Gameboy
Online](https://github.com/taisel/GameBoy-Online).

For more info, see the readme for [danShumway's original serverboy](https://github.com/danShumway/serverboy.js).
